# LAIRS & SentiNet Architecture (Public Overview)

This document describes the public, high-level architecture for the LAIRS & SentiNet platform. It focuses on structure, governance, and system boundaries. It intentionally omits production implementation details, keys, and deployable configurations.

---

## 1) Platform at a Glance

LAIRS is the cognitive runtime (memory, identity, orchestration).
SentiNet is the secure fabric (zones, default-deny segmentation, internal DNS/PKI).

[ Human Master Admin ]

+------------------------------+
| LAIRS (Mind) |
| - Runtime / Orchestration |
| - Memory + Identity |
| - Policy Hooks + Audit |

| SentiNet (Fabric) |
| - Zones + Default-Deny |
| - Internal DNS + PKI |
| - Controlled Bridge Modes |

| Sentinel Modules (Products) |
| AGENT | Gate | AV | Forge|

## 2) LAIRS Core (Cognitive Runtime)

LAIRS is a governed intelligence substrate. Models are treated as replaceable cognitive engines; governance and auditability are first-class.

+--------------------------------------------------+

LAIRS Brain
Session + Identity Manager
Policy Hooks / Authorization Gates
Tool & Action Router
Model Orchestrator (specialists + generalists)
Memory Interfaces
Audit Log / Event Ledger
+---------------------+----------------------------+
                  |
                  v
 +----------------+------------------+
 |                                   |
 v                                   v
+------------+ +----------------+
| State Store| | Vector Memory |
| (configs, | | (retrieval) |
| profiles) | +----------------+
+------------+ +----------------+
|
v
+----------------+
| Append-only |
| Event/Audit Log|
+----------------+


Key idea: **LAIRS governs actions** through policy gates and produces **verifiable evidence** via audit logs.

## 3) SentiNet Fabric (Security + Identity + Zones)

SentiNet provides environment-level safety: segmentation, service identity, and controlled ingress/egress.

                 +----------------------+
                 |   Controlled Bridge  |
                 |  (Mode B / Mode A)   |
                 +----------+-----------+
                            |
                            v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

SentiNet Zones
Zone 1: Core / Control -> LAIRS Brain + Governance
Zone 2: Security Services -> Gate, Watchdog, AV
Zone 3: Workloads/Apps -> User services, integrations
Zone 4: Edge/IoT/Endpoints -> Agents, sensors, devices
----------------------------------------------------------------
Default-Deny VLAN Segmentation + Service Identity (mTLS)
Internal DNS + PKI (cert issuance/rotation model)
+----------------------------------------------------------------+


SentiNet ensures:
- **default-deny** network posture
- **service identity** (cert-backed)
- **policy-enforced** flows between zones

## 4) Sentinel Module Suite (Product Boxes)

Sentinel modules are separate products that interlock through LAIRS (mind) and SentiNet (fabric).

+-------------------------+ +-------------------------+
| Sentinel AGENT | | Sentinel Gate |
|-------------------------| |-------------------------|
| Integrity + telemetry | | Policy enforcement |
| Anomaly detection | | Network controls |
| Evidence & audit feed | | Controlled ingress/egress|
+-----------+-------------+ +-----------+-------------+

| Sentinel AV | | Sentinel Forge |
|-------------------------| |-------------------------|
| Scan + quarantine | | Patch advisory pipeline |
| Trust scoring | | Staging + rollback model|
+-------------------------+ +-------------------------+

## 5) Governance Flow (Human Root Authority)

This is the platform’s non-negotiable safety model: the system may propose actions, but critical changes require explicit human authorization.

(Observation) -> (Analysis) -> (Proposal) -> (Approval) -> (Apply) -> (Verify)

+-----------+ +----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+ +--------+
| AGENT | -> | LAIRS | -> | Forge | -> | Human | -> | Apply |
| Gate / AV | | Reasoning| | Proposal | | Master | | (reboot|
+-----------+ +----------+ +-----------+ | Admin | | boundary|
+-----------+ +--------+
|
v
+---------------+
| Audit Evidence |
| + Rollback |
+---------------+


Principle: **No autonomous system modification.** The system can generate and test patches, but application requires human approval and controlled staging with rollback.

## 6) Repository Scope

This repository contains:
- public architecture descriptions
- diagrams and governance model
- module boundaries and system concepts

This repository does not contain:
- production code or binaries
- cryptographic keys or signing material
- deployment configs intended for real environments

Core implementations are maintained separately under controlled licensing.
